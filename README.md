<p align="center">A web extension that makes song/album/playlist titles selectable on Spotify web. (open.spotify.com)</p>

## Why?
Have you ever wanted to copy a song title from Spotify to send to a friend? Me too. Maybe this friend doesn't have Spotify, or maybe you want to find the music video on YouTube. There is currently no way to select and copy a song/album title, which is especially inconvenient when trying to search for a song in a foreign language you can't speak. This small extension makes some CSS changes on Spotify (web only) to allow users to copy titles from album/playlist header and the tracklist.

## Planned Features
- Enable/Disable
- Choose which parts of the UI are select-able
